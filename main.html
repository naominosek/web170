        <h2>The Game</h2>
        <p>You play as a member of a band of mercenaries. Throughout your adventure, you constantly decide which side to support, whether for monetary reasons or for ideological ones. Your choices throughout the game affect how the story plays out. Whether to try and defend the remaining humans from being murdered by the Boros by joining the Conclave, to save mankind and restore balance to the world by joining the Boros, or to somehow find out the secret of Rakdos.

                <h3>The Story</h3>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
